### Steps of React

1. Render out hard coded data
2. Model your data (similar to the processs in Rails)
3. Add state to your app
4. Make render use app's state (remove hard-codeing from render)
5. Handle events from interactive elements (onClick, onChange)
6. Connect those to methods that update the app's state (`this.setState`)

## Models

### User

- first name
- last name
